2004-10-23 --> Release 0.6

2004-10-22 - Added a patch to fix a bug in the FreeBSD UHCI code.
This bug prevented systems with an UHCI USB controller to boot (within an
hour) with an atuwi device attached.

2004-10-19 - ARGH!!!
Forgot to remove some debug printf-ing from if_atuwi.c before releasing 0.5.
The driver now says "Lal" for every sent packet :-s
Let's release 0.6 soon.

2004-10-18 --> Release 0.5

2004-10-16 - Added the atuwi-compile script.

2004-10-02 - Fixed a bug
Fixed a bug that caused us to not see networks with an "" empty SSID.

2004-09-30 - Added a device - AinComm AWU2000B
Thanks to Chris Whitehouse for supplying the ID's
VID: 0x12fd (AinComm)
PID: 0x1001 (AWU2000B)
Radio chipset: rfmd2958 / at76c505

2004-09-14 - Added a device - Linksys WUSB11 v2.8
Thanks to Alistair Phillips and Suihong Liang for supplying the ID's
VID: 0x1915 (Linksys)
PID: 0x2233 (WUSB11v28)
Radio chipset: rfmd2958 / at76c505

2004-08-23 - Added IFF_NEEDSGIANT to ifp->if_flags

2004-08-11 - Added bpf support for DLT_AIRONET_HEADER
This allows a user program to snif 802.11 packets with signal strength
indication.

2004-08-03 - Style fixes

2004-06-29 - Added a device - Linksys

2004-05-22 --> Release 0.4

2004-05-22 - Added handling for de-authentication packets.
If we receive a de-authentication packet the driver starts the
authentication again to re-connect to the AP.


2004-05-19 - Got the SMC2662W v.4 fully working
VID: 0x03eb (Atmel)
PID: 0x7614
Radio chipset: rfmd2958 / at76c505
The device required the right firmware image (destilled by hand from the
wind0w$ driver) and some quirks.
I believe I am the first one to get this device working outside of Wind0w$.


2004-05-13 - Added support for the TRENDnet TEW-229UB
VID: 0x03eb (Atmel)
PID: 0x7613
Radio chipset: rfmd2958 / at76c505


2004-05-04 --> Release 0.3
Fixed compile errors on 5.2 and later.


2004-04-20 - Added (not working) support for the SMC 2662W v4
VID: 0x03eb (Atmel)
PID: 0x7614
Radio chipset: rfmd2958 / at76c505
Uploading the internal firmware fails, but if the firmware is already
uploaded to the device using a Wind0ws PC (argh!) the device works like a
charm. This is a non-option in my point of view, but it's the best I can do
at this moment untill I have fully debugged the way Wind0ws uploads the
firmware to the device at the bit level.
Thanks to Martijn van Buul for pointing out the existence of these devices.


2004-02-27 - Added a device
Thanks to Peter Pilka for pointing out the USB ID's of the Sparklan WL-382f
VID: 0x03eb (Atmel)
PID: 0x7605
Radio chipset: rfmd / at76c503a


- Started CHANGELOG at version 0.2 - 2004-02-20 -
